I wonder if an existing sqlite3 database file can be fetched and used?
*I do think this is possible using OPFS. See notes for that elsewhere here.*

## Installing on Linux

Installed the sqlite3 command via:
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install sqlite3

NOTE: for some reason, downloading the Linux x86 binaries did not work. Perhaps they are 32bit?!
