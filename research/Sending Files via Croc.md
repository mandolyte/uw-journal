# croc

`croc` is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, _croc_ is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following:

-   allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay)
-   provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE)
-   enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
-   allows **multiple file** transfers
-   allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted
-   local server or port-forwarding **not needed**
-   **ipv6-first** with ipv4 fallback
-   can **use proxy**, like tor
