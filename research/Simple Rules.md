## How to create simple rules

1. Determine the objective
	- Keep it specific
 	- What you want more of or less of
1. Find the bottleneck
	- What's REALLY keeping you from your objective?
2. Craft the rules
	- Expert advice
	- Help from friends
	- Own experience


Suppose our objective is to "optimize translation by local church", then we might assess/measure success by:
- ease of training on the tools
- do the tools work in the environments where the translators work  (no/spotty internet, low end computers, etc.)
- can translators use other tools to create content

AFAICT, we only have three data formats: USFM, Markdown, and TSV. The latter two can easily be edited using Notepad and Libre Calc (respectively). Only USFM requires specialized tooling, but given its status as a standard it is hard to see that one can be changed. It is positive that we are de-customizing USFM by removing tW to the TWL TSV files. If we must use something like USFM, then it would be nice if it worked with any/most USFM tools.
