The last few days, serious work finally begun. Some decisions have been made and recorded in Discord on what we need to deliver first.
- no need for a tabbed interface yet... the sole functionality to be delivered is the "light repo validation".  Message link [here](https://discord.com/channels/867746700390563850/906161562287480902/907296957993734165)
- the light validation will be similar to what the cv app does

This initial work will be journalled over in the note for issue # 3

One thing we need is a nice Next.js based shell/template to use for the tabbed UI the mockups have. Here is the mockup:

I certainly could use some Next.js experience. So folder "Next.js" will contain notes, etc.
